Guidelines to Files and Order to be Run in

Step 1. Run data_collection_Hubble.py and data_collection_JWST
Step 2. Run download_data.ipynb or download_data.py (make sure to manually change from HST to JWST)
Step 3. Run fits_data_table.py
Step 4. Run catalog_extractor.py
Step 5. Run extractor_brightest_info_data_table.py and extractor_radius_info_data_table.py
Step 6. Run magnitude_corrector_calculator.py

Folder: data_collection_files
    - Where all the files related to data collection are

data_collection_HST.py: 
If there are images for the supernovae in HST at the resolved query, 
create a file that stores the point of the list in the order "SNID, RA, DEC"
    - File name that is returned back is valid_points_index_list_HST.csv

data_collection_JWST.py: 
If there are images for the supernovae in HST at the resolved query, 
create a file that stores the point of the list in the order "SNID, RA, DEC"
    - File name that is returned back is valid_points_index_list_JWST.csv

download_data.ipynb:
Downloads the data from the obeservations of either the JWST or HST valid points 
**IMPORTANT** must change from HST or JWST in corrected

download_data.py:
Same as download_data.ipynb but in a python file

extractor_brightest_info_data_table.py:
Create a datatable with the BRIGHTEST and LARGEST objects of each source extractor file
    - File returned back is brightest_galaxy.csv

extractor_radius_info_data_table.py:
Create a datatable with the RADIUS of objects of around the RA and DEC of each SN1 source extractor file
    - File returned back is radius_galaxy.csv

fits_data_table.py:
Create a datatable with most important information from the fits file 
    - File returned back is fits_summary.csv

magnitude_corrector_calculator.py:
Create a datatable that corrects for each magnitude of the brightest galaxy or the radius galaxy
    - File returned is corrected_mag.csv

Folder: data_files  
    - Where all of the data files end up going

brightest_galaxy.csv:
    - SNID,File_key,Galaxy_Key,RA_Galaxy,Dec_Galaxy,Position_Angle,Major_Axis,Minor_Axis,Mag,Mag_Error,Flux,Flux_Error
    - A list of the brightest galaxies from each of the MAST queries

fits_summary.csv:
    - SNID,filename,Date,Telescope,Instrument,Filter,CD1_1,CD1_2,CD2_1,CD2_2
    - Records the fits information of each image you have

HST.csv:
    - RA,Dec,SNID,has_f1
    - Este's HST image catalog from May 

magnitude_calculated.csv:
    - SNID,filename,Date,Photometric Calibration,Inverse Sensitivity,Zeropoint,Wavelength,Zeropoint AB
    - A list of the folders and their correcected magnitudes

unmatched_pantheon.csv
    - SNID,IAUC,host,RA,Dec,RA_host,Dec_host,zhel,zcmb,zhelerr,zHD,zHDerr,PV,vpecerr,RA_group,Dec_group,zhel_group,zcmb_group,zHD_group,PV_group,in_group,has_host,is_SNz,resolved_coord
    - The orginal file list AND resolved_coord
        - resolved_coord is a string of 'RA Dec' form
    - The most useful file in the whole set

unmatched_pantheon(in).csv:
    - SNID,IAUC,host,RA,Dec,RA_host,Dec_host,zhel,zcmb,zhelerr,zHD,zHDerr,PV,vpecerr,RA_group,Dec_group,zhel_group,zcmb_group,zHD_group,PV_group,in_group,has_host,is_SNz
    - The true orginal file

valid_points_index_list_HST.csv:
    - SNID,RA,Dec
    - Supernovae with the points that have IR or NIR data for HST (as of June 2025)

valid_points_index_list_JWST.csv:
    - SNID,RA,Dec
    - Supernovae with the points that have *data* for JWST (as of June 2025)

Folder: pantheon_data_folder
    - Each supernova has a folder with all of the MAST downloads
    - Ideally, it will be split by HST, HLA, and JWST
    - To get this folder, run download_data
    - **IMPORTANT** this folder takes up a lot of space 

Folder: source_extractor
    - For each supernova image in the pantheon_data_folder, this holds all of the source extractor files

Main folder:

default.cov:
    - The configuration file for source extractor 

default.param:
    - the parameter file for source extractor

default.sex:
    - the source extractor file
